# Toolbox Basics
## What is the Toolbox ?
The toolbox is the starting point of your mod. It'll allow you to create characters, songs, stages and weeks easily to save time.

In the Toolbox, you can see multiple tabs, such as:
- [Character Editor](toolbox/char.md)
- [Mod Info]()
- [Medals]()
- [Song Config]()
- [Songs]()
- [Stages JSON]()
- [Weeks]()
