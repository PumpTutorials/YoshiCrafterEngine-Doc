## How do i create one?

To create a new script for your song,
- Go to mods/Your Mod/data/Your Song/ and create a new file (must end up with `.hx` or `.lua`, NOT `.txt`)
- Open the song in the engine, open the Pause Menu, choose Developer Options and select "Open Charts Folder", then create the script here
- Create a script anywhere you want in your mod, and add it via the "Edit Song Scripts" button in the charter.
