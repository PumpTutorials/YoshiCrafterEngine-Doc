## __How to lock your mod.__

### What is locking your mod?

By locking your mod, Developer Mode will be automatically disabled once you're playing that mod, sort of like the Friday Night Funkin' default one.

The user won't be able to edit your mod via the Toolbox, or via the Dev Mode shortcuts in the pause menu.


### __How do i lock my mod?__

First of all, open your mod folder, then open the `config.json` file.

You'll see a lot of fields. The one that'll need to be changed is the `locked` field.

Change its value from `false` to `true`, save the file, and your mod will be locked.

### __How do i unlock my mod?__

To unlock your mod, you'll need to do the same procedure as above. Except, you'll need to change the `locked` value back from `true` to `false`.

You may need to switch to another mod then switch back to your mod to apply the effects, or restart the engine.
