# Custom Shaders
## __What is a shader?.__

A Shader is GPU code that is ran before the frame is drawn. It allows it to apply effect to your sprites such as inverting, switching colors, etc.

The shader code is divided in 2 parts: Fragment and Vertex.

Fragment documentation can be found [here](../assets/shaders/shader.frag.md).
